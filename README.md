# Metal Shader Effects for SwiftUI

Welcome to the Metal Shader Effects for SwiftUI project! This is an open-source project where I create various Metal Shader effects specifically designed for SwiftUI applications. 

## About This Project

I work on this project in my free time, adding new effects whenever I find the time to code more. As I am just starting out in iOS programming, please bear with me as I learn and improve along the way.

## Current Effects

- Color Mix Effect
